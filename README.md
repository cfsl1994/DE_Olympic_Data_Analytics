# DE_Olympic_Data_Analytics

### This data engineering lab project over AWS, GCP and Azure focuses on managing and processing data streams sourced from an open dataset about the Olympic Games hosted on GitHub. The process begins with data extraction using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools, followed by initial storage in a 'raw' data layer. Subsequently, these data are processed and transferred to an intermediary 'stage' layer for refinement. Finally, the data are integrated into a Data Warehouse (DWH), where they are treated as external data and made available for analysis and visualization using specialized data visualization tools. This project is based on Youtuber Darshil Parmar.
